Welcome to MathTest by Matthew Brown
  Simple Application for me to learn Android Development by creating a simple math quiz application.
  This is stored here so that I can access it where I want either at home or at work when I am using my labtop.
  
  The math quiz application will quiz the user over basic math skills specifically addition related
  maybe other skills since this can be done easily as a foundation of learning/developing/deploying an
  android application.
  
  *Changes*
  1.Changed it from only using 5 questions to 10 questions
  2.Changed the button to a spinner therefore removing the hard coded number of problem to being dynamically chosen
  3.Created a test class to see if I could dynamically display the problem to the screen before it used specific Image Holders now its completely dynamic
  4.Completely modified ProblemActivity where it no longer needed. Cloned it creating ProblemActivity2 for the process of dynamic problem display.
